# Discord.js-Leveling-System

This code defines a simple leveling and XP system in which users can earn XP by sending messages and leveling up when they reach the XP threshold for their current level. The XP threshold for each level is calculated by multiplying the level number by 100. You can modify this code to suit the specific leveling and XP mechanics of your Discord bot.
